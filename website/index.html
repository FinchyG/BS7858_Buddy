  <h2>What is BS7858 background screening?</h2>

    years: whether in employment, claiming benefits, in education or training, 
    outside of the UK, or other.</br>
    There are many documents that can verify each of these circumstances, and 
    this website’s aim, designed by two buddies who work in the industry, is to 
    show you how to pass your BS7858 screening.</br>
    Below are links to pages that can pin down the exact document(s) you’ll need to 
    use. Have a look, and let the Buddy be your guide to securing a career in the 
    security industry.</p>
